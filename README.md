# Enhancing-P2P-Network-Lending-Predictions
Negating the Risk: Enhancing P2P Network Lending Predictions Abstract—Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a major revolution in the field of finance where it transformed the complete market by eliminating the need for middlemen or conventional intermediaries such as banks where the borrower can contact directly with investors. In P2P lending the borrower can get loans with much more favorable interest rates and it could also be beneficial for investors to get high returns but there is a potential risk attached to it where there are chances of loan default. The complete lending system could suffer from significant losses if the number of cases of default increases. Some studies tried to address the problem of loan default by creating a classification model that predicts whether the loan will default or not but most of them suffer from the issue of an imbalanced dataset where the number of non-defaults is much higher than the number of defaults which could result in bias in the prediction made by the model. By addressing the problem of the imbalanced dataset and using various ensemble learning techniques, the goal of this study is to improve the accuracy of the prediction of default in a P2P lending network. To achieve that some optimizations were performed such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle an imbalanced dataset. Initially, 4 models namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), kNN, and Random Forest were used to determine which model can be used as the base model on top of which stacking can be performed to achieve prediction with the highest accuracy. The model was trained and tested using the Lending Club loan dataset. The evaluation of the model was performed using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The value of each of the base models and 3 stacking models where XGBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost are used for stacking were determined for all the evaluation metrics and it was found that Stacking XGBoost with Random Forest as a base learner, and when the evaluation was performed on pre-SMOTE data shown highest accuracy of 99.23.
